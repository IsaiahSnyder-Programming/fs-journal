# Daily Reflection

This is a stressful week! You are working on a project that closely mimics what you will be expected to accomplish during a standard 40 hour work week. Are you enjoying the struggles? Are you managing your time wisely?

I actually am enjoying my struggles. It can get a little frustrating sometimes of course, but in the end, my struggles are helping me grow more into becoming a better programmer, and thats exactly why Im here.
As far as I can tell from here, I seem to be managing my time very well. Im setting timers for everything, im taking consistent brain-breaks, and all-in-all it feels like smooth sailing so far.
