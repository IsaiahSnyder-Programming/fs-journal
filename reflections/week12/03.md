# Daily Reflection

Have you started the client? How is you vue application shaping up. Do you have the basics of data rendering to the page.

I started the client over the weekend. Im almost completely done. I had Mick check it earlier, and im completing more of the checkboxes than i had thought.

## Prompts

- How is today going?
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?
