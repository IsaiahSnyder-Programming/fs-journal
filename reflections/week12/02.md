# Daily Reflection

Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? How are you working? Client -> Server, focusing only on the server for now?

Ive actually made more progress than i was hoping for! I passed all the PostMan tests earlier this morning, and the frontend is going very sooth up to this point.

## Prompts

- How is today going?
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?
