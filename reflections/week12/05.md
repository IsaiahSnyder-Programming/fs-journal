# Final Reflection

The Final Week, The Final day of Course Work. How did it go? Are you ready for career week?

It went really well! I only got hung up on one concept throughout the entire project, that being the Private Vaults.
The hardest thing for me was remembering that Try/Catch can be used in more ways than just trying a function or failing it...
I felt super dumb for a while there, because the /catch can... well... do things... its good for more than just Logger...

## Prompts

- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
