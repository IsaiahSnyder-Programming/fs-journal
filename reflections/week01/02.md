## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

    Pseudo-Classes are selectors in CSS that are used to add styling onto a particular element, but ONLY when said element meets certain requirements.
    a Pseudo Class is represented by a : after a selector.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

    Specificity is when the webpage decides which CSS elements to use when multiple rules are targeting a particular element or property.
    The Pseudo Class will target things from a top-down perspective in this case, thus removing confusion, or further bugs if the computer is getting confused.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

    The !Important feature is primarily used to override a class or something similar in order to make an exception to the computers code.
    The issue with too many exceptions is that one may forget exactly what is and isnt important, too many extra "do this, but actually like this" just makes for messy code, and a confusing approach to CSS.

    Its much easier to just make a new class...
