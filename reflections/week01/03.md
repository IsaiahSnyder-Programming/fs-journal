## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

    I am absolutely in LOVE with colums and rows in bootstrap. I was struggling a lot with getting CSS to do what I wanted it to unless i spend hours and HOURS writing line after line just to make a grid system work in HTML.
    But, now that I understand basic bootstrap, I will be using their grid system a LOT.


2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

    The very first thought that comes to mind is look at other websites and find those that you like.
    You can use Win-Paint to help yourself figure out their similarities, and go from there.

    Alternatively, you could look at Mark's GitHub Protfolio and just steal stuff from that.


3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

    When someone goes onto a website, they dont want to drag their eyes through twenty-something black text paragraphs on a stark white screen just to find more paragraphs below that with little to no difference from the above paragraph, just so they can read your list of skills on the depressingly naked webpage you designed.

    People dont look at websites purely for information. They expect comfortability. They expect accessability. They expect professionalism.
    They open the webpage with many pre-made expectations. And it is the developers job to meet those expectations.

    Thats where design comes in:
    You could make a website with HTML only, and it could look pretty okay if you had 3,000 lines of code.
    But if its just a bunch of blocks and letters on a screen, people wont be impressed. It wont be EASY to visit your site. So, a developer should use design to make it easy and even enjoyable for someone to visit their site.
