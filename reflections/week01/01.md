## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

    Git is used for a number of reasons: the biggest being a way for multiple developers to work on the same project all at once without there being many if any issues or problems that come with working as a group. This way, every team member can have the same code and an updated project in order to create minimal issues with communication, updates, and the like.

    It also acts similarly to a backup file: that way if anyone within the project loses their code, kills their harddrive, or corrupts their files, they can then look back at Github and pick right back up at their previous save state instead of needing to completely redo the entire project from scratch.

    And lastly, it can serve as a testing ground: Git records any and every change that happens within a project, and records it. This can be used both to go back to a previous save state if needed, or to create multiple brances in order to test new code, try something new within the project, or even create two, three, or more alternate results so as to have a few different ways of completing said project.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

    The benefits of having multiple brances is twofold:

    Firstly, it makes for a perfect testing ground: if any developer wants to try something new, or implement a large amount of changes into a project, they can create a branch to do so, so as not to completely destroy the initial project if something goes wrong, or if they ruin the entire file completely.

    Secondly, you can use this both to create multiple outcomes for a project, and to merge your own tests within the main branch in order to maximise both safety and efficiency.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

    The difference between Git and GitHub is that GitHub is this:

    Git is a source control program that tracks the changes within your project, and saves it onto a local direcory within your personal computer, thus making it easier and safer to code at will, and look back at your saves if need be.

    GitHub is a cloud-based program that compiles and saves multiple files and code from your computer up into the cloud. Meaning any person you wish can look into your code, see how you built your project, and even save it onto their own computer without the hastle of thumbdrives, external harddrives, or large, annoying emails.
