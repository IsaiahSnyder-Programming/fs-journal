## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

Wireframing is incredibly useful for web-developers for many reasons. In short, it can be used to create a "sketch" or a "rough draft" of your clients webpage in order to get feedback LONG before you even put down a line of code. Because your client doesnt want to look at your sketchup of code. They would rather see a thrown together website with pictures and colors and fancy *things*.
So, you have a client? Be smart, get their feedback early, use wire-framing.



2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

Theres three major levels to wire-frame detail:
Low, Medium, and High

They all serve their own purpose:
The low is REALLY quick and easy to throw together and can be done in a matter of minutes in order for the developer to have a general idea of pixel/visual size of each element on the page, and gives the visual peoples a way to scrap together a concept in their head even before going to code.



3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

I very much think wire-frames are worth the time, energy, and effort... in most situations:
Sometimes you just... dont need a wireframe. Maybe youve got an idea for a website and you just threw a bunch of code down, and bam, youve got a rough draft.
But wire-framing is 100% worth it if you want to come up with a basic structure, whether thats for a team, or just for yourself.
But its even more useful if you have a client who wants to see the ideas you have on their website so that they can give you feedback on it in order to create the closest thing to their wants as possible.
