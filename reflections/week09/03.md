## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

It is a system that converts an entire image down into a readable string that can then be used throughout the network without losing data


2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

One of the bigger ones:
Base64 makes files 1/3 bigger than their original... Which, if youre using a lot of these files, it means you could be taking up a lot more space tan you expected


3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

People didnt use mobile phones the same way in the past. Base64 is not necessarily intended for mobile platforms, making it incredibly slow on phones and the like
