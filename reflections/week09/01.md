## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

One of the biggest things weve been using in our group is SCRUM. We do multiple standups... very regularly to keep everyone updated on where each other is, who needs help, and how we can shuffle our group so that no one is getting burnt out.


2. What went well so far?

The whole project so far is going a lot smooter than I imagined. Its looking good, things are functioning well, and the whole group is getting along super, super well


3. What would you do differently? Why?

Im not entirely sure at this point. I dont know how full blown companies run these kinds of things, so all I can add to this is that our whole group needs to work on taking breaks more frequently... because we all have the personalities to just work for 4 hours and get burnt out
