## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

Encapuslation is basically a security system for the internal workings of your program. Its used to hide and protect data that the programmer doesnt want the user to have access to.


2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

Before the Private Fields Proposal, there werent many ways to create private properties. And so some developers instead began to start prefixing wanted private properties with underscores, which kinda broke the method that closures already had.


3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

Well, theres no DIRECT way to do this, but the Encapsulation process is a pretty good way to achieve that. THis way, a variable can be made and manipulated, but the user wont have any access to it unless they spend a really long time looking through the front end of the code in order to manipulate just one little variable.
