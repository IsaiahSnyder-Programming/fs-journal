## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

Timeboxing is sort of like mini Sprints, where a certain amount and location of time is set aside for a very particular project or problem, and that must be completed within that timeframe.


2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

a. Strategic Quitting would be an incredibly valuable Timeboxing habit to get into: Often I will find myself struggling with a problem, or spending more time on something that isnt as important yet all because Im not paying attention.

b. I know my Golden Hour, but I need to start using it accordingly. Normally I will use my Golden Hour for writing, but shifting my schedule around and using it for problem solving could improve my productivity significantly.

c. I am very good at Swallowing The Frog, but sometimes I am unaware of where or what the frog is. If I know what the hardest issue is going to be, then I know to get it out of the way as soon as possible (especially when Im in Lab), but sometimes Im not very sure what the hardest part will be.
And I know that will come with time and practice, but learning to identify that will be a great use to me


3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how?

The 3rd Checkpoint would have been an extremely valuable time for me to Timebox, because I ran into a very particular issue:
I got stuck. I set aside time for me to work on the last problem I was having, and in the end, I didnt even get it done.
What I should have done is struggled on it within a very particular timebox, and then as soon as that timebox was up, add a new Todo to my list and make a new timebox to get help in.
