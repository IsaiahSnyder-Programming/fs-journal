## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

One-To-One
One-To-Many
Many-To-Many


2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

Linking restricts things a bit better than embedding however embedding is much simpler to use


3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

In a many-to-many relationship, items and objects and information can grow to a fairly large and unorganized scale. So, using things like third-party embedding (where you essentially create a master-file that handles and controls all of your objects and such) can be incredibly helpful and efficient.
Its like a computer with too many pictures in it. Its much better to put all of your pictures in files according to year, or place, or content, or anything really instead of just having all of the pictures just spewn all over the room.
