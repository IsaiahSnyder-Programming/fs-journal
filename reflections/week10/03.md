## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

A row in SQL is normally a small table which has all of an object items properties upon it.
The column is the definition of which property, ans can range from Name to Description, and so on.


2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters(
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  createdAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updatedAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description varchar(5000) DEFAULT 'no description provided',
) default charset utf8;


3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

DELETE FROM table_name just means you are deleting a single or multiple items or properties of said items within a singular table.
DROP TABLE table_name means you are completely removing the entire table and all of its contents.
