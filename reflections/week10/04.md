## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

You should use enums when a variable can only take one out of a small set of possible values


2. How can you modify an Enum?

Reflections seem to do the trick


3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

We havent used enums quite yet, but it seems like these could be quite useful to hold values like an order of months, or an amount of exquisite james and jellies.
