## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value type
Reference type
Pointer type


2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

Its a data type that holds a value... 
The difference is, the system creates a copy of a variable to use across each page, so if you change that value within a page, it ultimately doesnt affect the parent variable


3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

The reference type stores the address of the location where the actual value is stored instead of the value itself.
