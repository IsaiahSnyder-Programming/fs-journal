## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?

A list is an object which holds variables in a specific order. The type of variable that the list can store is defined using generic syntax


2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

Lists provide a functionality to create a list of objects, find list items, sort those items, search throughout the list, and so on


3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

The List<L>.Sort() method normally works fine, but List<L>.FirstOrDefault() seems to work much better
