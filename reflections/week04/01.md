> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

Callback Hell will often happen when someone tries to make their code work perfectly from top to bottom, instead of reorganizing things for a cleaner chunk of code.


2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

Asynchronous code allows your program to execute the code immediately rather than waiting for a line-by-line process.


3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

1. Keep your code shallow
    a. Cleaning up your code, using var and const often, and generally just letting one thing call back to another usually makes for cleaner, more readable code.

2. Modularize
    a. MAKE LIBRARIES AND DICTIONARIES. Its much better to add a whole new .js page full of objects and definitions than to leave a ton of variables and messy code all on one page

3. Handle every single error
    a. Create logs and .error functions early on in order to identify and clean out your code IMMEDIATELY when an error occurs. This means you can nip the problem in the bud VERY early on, and you dont have to make a bunch of crunched code just to adjust one little problem.
