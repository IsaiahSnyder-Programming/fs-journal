## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?

Async and Await are used when you are working with multiple .js files and an API. The API sometimes takes a minute to spinup, or load, or get the information to the promise, so the await and async are perfect for handling this. If a function is async, that means it should only run in parallel with other particular functions in relation to an API. Await functions are used when a developer needs to tell a certain line to Wait until a promise is fulfilled or something is gotten.


2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?

Async essentially is the Await for a function. They normally look like this:

async function doThing() {
    console.log(things)
}

Whereas an await is used directly between the code and the API. Theyll normally look like this:

let res = await api.get(stuff)


3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?

Async and Await are fantastic because they can make multiple .js files run together in harmony with an API, meaning if something within the page or API is taking longer to get than it should, then thats okay, because that means that your program will just sit and twirl their fingers until theyre told when to do something instead of just running anyway without the informatiuon that it needs and then throwing errors and breaking and all kinds of bad stuff.
