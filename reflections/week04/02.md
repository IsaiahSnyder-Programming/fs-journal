## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

1. Pending
2. Resolved
3. Rejected


2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

Promises are used to clean up the step-by-step problem used in code. They essentially 'promise' the code something, and then they make the code wait until that promise is fulfilled so that if something does have to do a small process of step-by-step, it is done in the correct order and organization between different .js pages


3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

(we technically use .try() right now, but):
A .then() function is used when a promise is successfully fulfilled. If a promise comes back with everything it promised to the program, .then() the code runs the rest of the way, and things turn out successfully.
A .catch() is what is used if the .then() function comes back without everything it promised. The code cannot run without 100% of the promises completion, so if the promise cant find what it was looking for, then a .catch() is run, and its only job is to throw an error explaining that the promise wasnt kept within the code.
