## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

console.log() is the main way, which can be used to find syntax errors, reference errors, or type errors. it can also be used in order to tell you things that ARE working, and sometimes things that just arent.


2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The elements tab shows you your HTML and CSS and is really helpful due to the fact that you can make adjustments or changes in your html that will instantly show up on your webpage, thus making is simpler and faster to know what to change in your actual code.


3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

Well, youve got debugger, but my personal favorite way of debugging is write a tiny chunk of code, and test it... over and over and over.
and if at any point something DOESNT work, then you only have one or two lines of code to look at and debug, rather than 57 or something.
