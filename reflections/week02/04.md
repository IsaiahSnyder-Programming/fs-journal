## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

Making a plan is SUPER helpful for me because i need to see the project im working on in order to identify what kind of potential problems i could run into, what kinds of functions or whatever are gonna need to go into it an so on. It really helps me to map things out and make a plan, because then ill know what to work on in what order, and whether or not i can work on other things if im stuck in one spot for too long.


2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

I start with google a lot of the time. I google a LOT... and 75% of the time, i find something somewhere that helps me identify what i may or may not have done wrong.
After that, i reference other good code. Maybe there was a similar problem in the code we learned during the lecture. Maybe i can use those examples to make my own code work...

And if that doesnt work... i seek out professional help with my âœ¨problemâœ¨


3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

There were two big things:
Firstly being: I dont always have to go with the first solution i come up with. I understand there may be a million other ways to fix a problem, but i want to make MY way work... and oftentimes... im just completely wrong.

And secondly: dont clutter my code... and DEFINITELY dont clutter someone elses.
I do my best to keep my code clean and readable... and i use WAY too many notes and stubs and things, but i really, really like the organization.
But, im just glad an actual article that i read from someone whos been in code for a long time said the same exact thing: dont be messy... and try and clean up after yourself and others.
