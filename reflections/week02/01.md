## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

Scope essentially describes where each variable is available and allowed to be used


2. What is Hoisting ?

Hoisting is essentially where a variable is 'hoisted' to the top of its scope, and then further used as 'undefined'


3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

Let is the most versatile and built to be used in a number of ways, which is why its the most usable and the most popular

Var is older, so its got some fun little bugs, but can be useful in some chunks of code

Const is very similar to Let, however it cannot be updated, so its useful for a handful of things, due to its un-updateable-ness, but wouldnt be used ALL the time.
