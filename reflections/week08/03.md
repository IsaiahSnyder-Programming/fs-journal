## Questions

1. What is Software Development Testing?

Software Development Testing is just like any kind of testing anywhere: MAKE SURE THE THING WORKS.
Its no different than someone taste testing a new brand of ice cream: You check to make sure your product will live up to company and human standards, to ensure people will actually be COMFORTABLE using your product.


2. What are the benefits of Testing in software development?

You as a dev team are supposed to make a project or product that works for "dumb people".
Most people dont follow the processes and brain of a software developer. Meaning you need someone to TRY and break your code, because there is SOMEONE SOMEWHERE who is dumb enough to click on a button too fast after inputting something into a search form that then breaks your page and 3 errors pop up and now your site is borken and that person doesnt want to come back...
You need someone to run through those scenerios so that way your product is as efficient and clean as possible.


3. What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?

In my PERSONAL opinion, I think testing is mandatory towards making a good product. Whether thats in software development or otherwise... THins SHOULD be tested. ANd while one of the major drawbacks of that is the time it takes to test, and fix, and test, and fix could be REALLY long, its 100% worth it in making a well developed product.
