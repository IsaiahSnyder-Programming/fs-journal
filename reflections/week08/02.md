## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

Communication on any team is important. WHether its in the workforce, or at home, or in relationships... communication in general is important all for the same reason:
You Are Working With Another Person.

Not everyone works the same. Not everyone thinks the same. Not everyone has the same processes or discipline or tasks or anything.
Everyone is different, and communication is what can help a variety of individuals work as a fully functioning team.
THis can range from helping one or two team members understand what theyre supposed to do, or even down to helping the rest of the team uinderstand how they can pick up someone elses slack if they cant fully complete something.
Communication is key.
If you dont have it, you cant move forward.


2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

Most SCRUM teams are made up of about 7-9 people. Product owner, scrum master, dev team, etc.
However, when working in a group that happens to be smaller than this, some adjustments that need to be made can range from one person taking on multiple titles, or some people doing things they arent quite comfortable with because of the lack of humans and hands.


3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
