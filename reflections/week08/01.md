## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

A developer portfolio is the perfect place to prove your skills, show off your enthusiasm, and give portential employers and clients a taste of how good of an idea it is to work with you.


2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

A developer portfolio is so effective because you can show how quality your work is without having to waste someones time by ACTUALLY coding out an entire program in front of them.


3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

Well, the Capstone is really my first project that Ill be proud enough to put into a portfolio. The other projects that I have completed at CodeWorks have not been my favorite, because of the amount of cramming put into them. But, Im really loving where this Capstone is going, and that will definitely end up on there.

I also have a good amount of Interactive C# programs and files that may end up on there, depending on where I find myself with them by the end of the cohort.
My reason for adding these is because it really encapulates what I LIKE to do with coding, that being GameDev. And sure, most companies arent looking for someone who is good at game dev, but its still a few projects Im working on that im proud enough of to share.
