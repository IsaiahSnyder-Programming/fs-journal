## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit Testing
Component Testing
End-To-End Testing


2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

Unit testing is REALLY useful, due to the fact that you can fix and clean up code LONG before sending it to your testers. You can also use it to make sure your code wont bug itself out within 2 days of actually starting.


3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

Component testing SEEMS to be the least useful out of the three ONLY because the other two seem to overshadow it: Unit testing is just the whole COde small Miss small process, and E2E is the final, lets make sure EVERYTHING works process...
COmponent testing just makes sure each component works. Which is REALLY important, but in my opinion the other two are REALLY useful and important in the end.
