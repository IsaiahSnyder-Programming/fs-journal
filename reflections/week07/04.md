# Sprint Retrospective

## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

A lot of Pair Programming was used, which helped keep some of our code less buggy


2. What went well this week?

I learned a lot about myself through this project. Which was both a good thing, and partially a bad thing.
The means by which i learned these things was not the most pleasent, but i learned a lot, and was able to implement a lot of Pair Programming into coding.


3. What would you do differently?

This week did not go very well in all honesty. Im not complaining at all, or blaming anyone, but it does make a project very difficult to build when you have to walk your partner through each step.
My partner was a great guy, but not necessarily a good programmer, which affected me very poorly, and even costed me a strike that I didnt think i would be taking at all by this point in the course.
So, I would say that next time, I'll make sure that if i am going to get help on a project, its with someone who i know can contribute, rather than hinder.
