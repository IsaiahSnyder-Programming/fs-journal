## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

I have had a blast, honestly. The course has been a great learning opportunity for me, and ive learned a lot more about myself than just the fact that i can kinda code. Ive realized a wide spread of things ranging from things im good at, and things that need work.
Its been great to have the instructors that ive had, and the other students have been super awesome as well!
All in all, ive loved it!
