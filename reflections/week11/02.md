## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

A primary key is used to ensure data in the specific column is unique. A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database that provides a link between the data in two tables.

2. What is an `Alias`?

Aliases essentially give a table, column, or row a temporary name.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)




SELECT
    d.*,
    p.*
FROM doctors d
JOIN patients p ON d.id = p.id
WHERE p.id = doctorId;

```
