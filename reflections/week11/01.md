## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

inheritance allows us to create a new class from the "blueprint" of another class.

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

Not all members are inherited. Child classes dont inherit everything from their parent, meaning you have to set what can and cant be inherited based on a members visibility.

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

Accessability essentially decides whether or not a member of a class is visible or not.
